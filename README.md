Merged DS3231 functions from: github/coobro/RTClib  by  MrAlvin 2012-02-27
and Alarm code for DS3231 heavily used/modified from Eric Ayars DS3231 library  by  Coobro

Corrections for DS3231 by eriktheV-king on 2018-01-09 (lines 494 and 509)
   working code additions for issues #81 and #86 in RTClib.cpp as of 2018-01-09
   https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib/issues
   The corrected .cpp file adding the readSqwPinMode() function in the DS3231 part of the .cpp file as proposed in issue #81 bugged when I  tried to compile.
   
Brought back read_i2c_register and write_i2c_register functions
to keep compatibility with lostPower, readSqwPinMode, writeSqwPinMode functions
due to previous heavy rewrite

Mods by Vking on 2019-04-28:
added DS3231 functions RTC_DS3231:: setBBSQW getBBSQW setINTCN getINTCN setA1F 
   to get and to set BBSQW pin to on to enable batterybacked SQW-INT function
                     (is OFF on first powerup),
   to get and to set INTCN pin to on to enable batterybacked INT function,
                     (is ON on first powerup)
   to clear the A1F flag in SQWINT (set it to false)
